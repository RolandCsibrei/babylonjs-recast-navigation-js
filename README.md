# babylon.js + vite + ts + recast-navigation-js

## Description

babylon.js plugin for <https://github.com/isaac-mason/recast-navigation-js>

Supports single thread, worker and wasm.

This is a drop in replacement for the existing plugin. You don't need to change anything in your code just one line where you import the plugin.

## Instructions

- clone or download the repo
- npm install
- For development: `npm run dev`
- For production: `npm run build` then to preview what was built `npm run preview`

### How to use the plugin in your project

- copy the `src/navigation` folder to your `src` directory. The plugin itself is located in the `src/navigation/plugin` folder. The other files are optional to use.

- `npm i recast-navigation`

### How to change the running mode of recast-navigation-js

Look at these file how to use and init recast-navigation-js in different modes.

- Single thread mode `src/navigation/navigation.single-thread.ts`
- Worker mode `src/navigation/navigation.worker.ts`

There are currently only two examples. The default one is the implementation of the playground code <https://playground.babylonjs.com/#KVQP83#0> from the babylon.js docs.

You can swich to run the other example(s) by chaging the imported class in `src/RecastNavigationJSApp.ts`:
